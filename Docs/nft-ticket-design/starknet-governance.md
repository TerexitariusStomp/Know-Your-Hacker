# Starknet Governance

A dapp was created in Cairos in alignment with the Starknet ecosystem. The dapp allows event organizers to vote if an attendee is allowed to attend an event or not. Once your wallet is connected you can cast a vote. One wallet equals one vote. There's a summary area for further details along with a link to forum discussion. At the end there is a table portraying all the different votes that have taken place.&#x20;
