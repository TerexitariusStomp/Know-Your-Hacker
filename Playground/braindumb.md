### The problem it solves

DESCRIBE WHAT CAN PEOPLE USE IT FOR, OR HOW IT MAKES EXISTING TASKS EASIER/SAFER E.T.C (MARKDOWN SUPPORTED)

### Old Statement

EthMunich is a great success. 🙏 Hoping that the organizers will find the power to organize it again, we suggest integrating Web3 features: We checked where bounty sponsors can be leveraged along the existing user journey.
**Problem 1: Producing a ticket 🎫 upon arrival isn't enough, you also need ID. As EthMunich organizers told us, this is because any ticket could have changed hands annonymously after it was claimed from pretix.**
--> We integrated PUSH.org + Molecule in the hospitality user flow to ensure all Hackers coming to the venue, really are who they say they are. (Add-on: Reception may also whitelist Hackers if the produce ID/Passport)

**Problem 2: Winners are to be KYCed to receive payout.**
--> Integrating Molecule early in the user flow, all winners are KYCed automatically.

**Problem 3: In a year from now, everyone forgot what happened at EthMunich 2023.**
--> We integrate non-transferable functional NFTs for token-gating: Winners can claim Winner's Discord Role

### New Statment

Story:
We have Roman. Roman has a geourgeus Background in sports event.

- Winners need to go through KYC process for payout
- People forget what happened at EthMunich 2023
